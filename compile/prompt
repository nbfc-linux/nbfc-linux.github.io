Write a complete HTML file that uses JavaScript to help users generate a ./configure command for a software build system.

The page should:

Contain a set of checkboxes for the following --disable- options.
If a checkbox is checked, the corresponding flag should be included in the generated command.
If it is unchecked, the flag should be omitted.

The options are:

--disable-syslog: Don't log to syslog in daemon mode

--disable-ec-debug: Disable debugging of reads/writes from/to the embedded controller

--disable-ec-dummy: Disable the dummy embedded controller implementation

--disable-ec-dev-port: Disable the /dev/port embedded controller implementation

--disable-ec-sys: Disable the embedded controller implementation that relies on the ec_sys kernel module

--disable-ec-acpi: Disable the embedded controller implementation that relies on the acpi_ec kernel module

The checkbox code should be easy to adapt, ideally by defining the options in an array with flags and descriptions.


Include a dropdown (ComboBox) for the --with-init-system option.
It should offer the values systemd, openrc, and systemv, with systemd selected by default.


Include text input fields for these options, with the following default values:

--prefix: default /usr

--sysconfdir: default /etc

--bindir: default /usr/bin


Automatically regenerate the ./configure command and display it on the page whenever the user changes any of the checkboxes, dropdowns, or text inputs.

The goal is to generate a user-friendly UI for dynamically building the correct ./configure command, with real-time updates.
The result should be a clean, minimal HTML/JS page that could be used locally or embedded in documentation.
